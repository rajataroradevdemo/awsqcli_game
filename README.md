Game Creation using Amazon Q Developer CLI

Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we interact with computers, particularly in development fields like programming, application design, and especially game development.

Game development has long been a dream for many developers ‚Äî but turning that dream into reality often demands a steep learning curve. Traditional game development requires experience across a range of complex areas:

UI/UX design
Story and game plotting
Mastery of programming languages
Graphics and animation programming
Game engine tools and frameworks
This multi-disciplinary requirement can be overwhelming. As a result, many aspiring developers find themselves stuck, lose motivation, or quit before completing their first game.

But this is where AI is making a massive difference. From AI-powered design tools to code generation, and from procedural content creation to adaptive storytelling ‚Äî AI is lowering the entry barrier and empowering developers to bring their creative visions to life faster and more easily.

What once took months of manual effort can now be prototyped in days. We‚Äôre witnessing a democratization of game development, where passion matters more than prior experience.

Game development has always fascinated me, but honestly, it can feel overwhelming. There‚Äôs so much to learn ‚Äî UI design, story flow, coding, graphics‚Ä¶ the list goes on. Like many others, I‚Äôve often put it on the back burner, thinking it would take months (if not more) to actually build something.

But recently, I tried out Amazon Q Developer CLI, an AI tool from Amazon that helps developers code faster. I gave it a few prompts just to see what it could do ‚Äî and to my surprise, it did everything.

It set up the project, wrote the code, and even handled some of the core game logic. What would‚Äôve taken me days or weeks was up and running in minutes.

It honestly felt like having a co-pilot guiding me through the process.

This experience really showed me how AI is changing the game. It‚Äôs making things possible for developers who may not have years of experience in game dev, but have the passion and creativity to build something fun.

If you‚Äôve ever wanted to build a game but felt stuck, I highly recommend checking out tools like Amazon Q Developer CLI. It might just surprise you like it did me.

What we need to begin :

Setup Amazon Q Developer CLI on you PC / Laptop
Game development library like PyGame

So, Let‚Äôs continue to see what I tried to build and how it worked out :

üéÆ My Game Idea: A Fun-Filled Run & Chase Adventure
Growing up, I absolutely loved watching Tom and Jerry. The way they were always chasing each other around ‚Äî smashing into irons, sofas, bats, laundry ‚Äî it was pure chaos and pure fun! That memory has always stuck with me, so I thought: why not turn that into a game?

üê≠üê± The Concept
The game is all about a hilarious chase between two cartoon characters ‚Äî think of a cat and a mouse, or maybe a naughty sibling duo. One character is always trying to run away while the other tries to catch them. But along the way, there are tons of funny obstacles and surprises.

üí• What Makes It Fun?
Chase Mode:
One player runs, the other chases. Simple, fast-paced, and full of action. Roles can even switch mid-game to keep it exciting!
Crazy Obstacles Everywhere:
Players crash into irons, sofas, frying pans, laundry baskets ‚Äî you name it! Some of these can even be picked up and used as traps or weapons. Slip on a banana peel, get stuck in a vase, or slam into a door that slams back!
Power-ups to Shake Things Up:
Imagine grabbing roller skates to zoom ahead, a helmet to protect you from hits, or a soap bar to make your chaser slide right past you.
üè† Where It Happens
The game takes place in super fun environments:

A messy house full of objects you can trip over or use
A backyard with garden tools and water puddles
City rooftops with clotheslines and chimney stacks
Each level would have its own set of wacky challenges.
üé® The Look & Feel
The art style would be fun, colorful, and cartoonish ‚Äî just like the classic cartoons we all grew up with. Big reactions, funny sound effects, and exaggerated animations when characters bump into stuff!

Prompt for Amazon Q Developer CLI
Prompt for AI Game Creation Tool:

I want to create a 2D side-scrolling chasing game inspired by Tom and Jerry.

Game concept: Jerry is running continuously on a platform, and Tom is chasing him.
Player control: The user controls Tom using the keyboard:
Space bar or up arrow key to jump.
Gameplay mechanics:
Jerry throws various obstacles on the ground to slow down Tom. Obstacles include iron bars, sofas, bats, water puddles, gloves, hangers, and other household items.
Tom must jump over these obstacles to keep chasing Jerry.
Each successful jump gives the player 1 point.
If Tom hits or gets stuck on an obstacle, the game is over.
Visual style: Fun, cartoonish, with clear character animations for running, jumping, and crashing.
Sound effects: Include distinct sounds for running footsteps, jumping, obstacle impacts (crash), and background chase music to enhance fun and immersion.
Additional features: Smooth, responsive controls and increasing difficulty over time by varying obstacle frequency or speed.
As a results Amazon Q CLI Create the following game for me :


Its reading the provided prompt and thinking before creating


And then it will create a game file for you. Allow it to create and save game file on your PC / Laptop.


Great it has create a Game for me in few minutes, Now lets run and start playing it.


It create a game for me, but i was very disappointed with the graphics and character it used , then i started putting up the graphics and converted it to a more modern version of the game, and then Finally i got my Game ready


You can download the source code from my GitHub repo and start playing this game.
